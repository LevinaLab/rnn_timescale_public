# Summary of analysis codes

Codes for running different analysis on trained networks.


### Timescale analysis
Codes are located in the "timescales" folder. "compute_taus.py" script contains the code for loading different networks, simulating them forward and saving $\tau$ and $\tau_{net}$ as described in the manuscript.

### Network dynamics analysis
Codes are located in the "network_dynamics" folder. "compute_pca.py" script contains the code for loading different networks, simulating them forward and computing the dimensionality of population activity using PCA.

### Ablation and perturbation analysis
